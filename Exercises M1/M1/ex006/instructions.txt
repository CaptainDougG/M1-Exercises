The Student class has three instance variables (also sometimes known as members).
Note that these instance variables are all set as private, which means that they are not visible (in scope) to any other class, 
including the unit test included for this exercise. In other words, these variables are encapsulated.

The class already has a constructor, which takes in initial values for each of the three instance variables.

Thus, you need to provide public accessors for each of the instance variables in the Student class.
In other words, you will need 3 "getters" that "expose" the underlying values. Also, you will need to set the instance variables
to the initial values that are passed to the constructor.
